I added HTML semantic tags header, nav, main, aside, and footer. Also added an alt to all the img tags and space between each element to make it easier to read the code. I noticed that div class="search-engine-optimization" did not have an id tag like the others, so I added an id. 

In the style.css I combined classes that had the same styles and renamed some tags that were listed as classes in CSS. I added a hover, focus, and active feature on the navigation links so that it can be accesible and noticable when you focus or click on the links. I also added a target:"_blank" to them in the HTML file to make it easier to navigate back to the homepage. I find it annoying when I click on a link on a webpage and then I have to backspace back into the original webpage. 

I tried my best to make the webpage as accesible as I could. I was not able to figure out how to add css reset and normalize so that the webpage can be the same on all browsers. Another thing I was unable to do was to make the nav links stay in the same position if the webpage is minimized.
